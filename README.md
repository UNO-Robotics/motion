*****For New Members*****

_It is highly recommended that you ignore the code provided until
you have gone through the **ALL** of the motion workshops at least once. Although you will end up with the same code as provided in this repository, you will gain a much deeper understanding by writing the code yourself._

### What kind of robot is this library for?

This library was designed for robots using an Arduino board, four stepper motors and four Mecanum wheels.

### Using the motion library

Clone or download this repository and rename the *team_name_here* directory and *team_name_here.ino* file to whatever you desire.

You will also need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

Most of the variables in *constants.h* are unassigned. Their values will be largely dependent on the build of your robot. In order to find these values, you will need to go through some of the workshops provided. 

Once you've filled in all of the variables in *constants.h* your robot will be ready to do your bidding.
